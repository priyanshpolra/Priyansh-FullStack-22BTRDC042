 🚀 Getting Started

To experience the project smoothly, just follow these simple steps:

1️⃣ Begin with the Backend
	•	Start the backend server first.
	•	This ensures all APIs and database connections are ready before the frontend runs.

2️⃣ Move to the Frontend
	•	Once the backend is up and running, launch the frontend.
	•	The frontend communicates with the backend to shorten URLs and fetch results.

3️⃣ Access the Application
	•	Open your browser and head to the provided local address.
	•	You’ll now see the URL Shortener in action! 🎉

✨ Always remember: Backend first → then Frontend → then Browser.
